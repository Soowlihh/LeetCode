# LeetCode Solutions (C++)

## Overview
This repository contains curated C++ solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by problem number.  
The focus is on **clean implementations**, **efficient data structures**, and **common interview patterns**.

Solutions emphasize correctness, time/space complexity, and readability rather than brute-force approaches.

---

## Language
- C++

---

## Problem Organization
Each folder is named after the LeetCode problem number and contains:
- One or more C++ solution files
- (When applicable) brief comments explaining the approach

---

## Patterns Covered
The problems in this repository practice common technical interview patterns, including:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack / Monotonic Stack
- Hash Maps
- Binary Search
- Linked Lists
- Trees (DFS / BFS)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (introductory)

## Recommended Problems
A short list of representative problems solved in this repository:
- 11 – Container With Most Water
- 20 – Valid Parentheses
- 121 – Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- 239 – Sliding Window Maximum
- 424 – Longest Repeating Character Replacement
- 76 – Minimum Window Substring

---

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Recognize and apply standard algorithmic patterns
- Prepare for technical interviews for software engineering internships

---

## Notes
This repository is actively updated as I continue practicing data structures and algorithms.
